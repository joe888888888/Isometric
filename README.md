Documenting this pygame project in the down time before I get a new laptop

Eric said I should do this more (and more means doing it one time, so here I am)

Very few people will likely see this, and if I ever want to actually make a legit github for a job or something (idk, idek how to work this at all)
then I'll probaly make a new account

Is that against github terms...

I hope to make something kind of cool with my old mac, but I am getting an upgrade soon as I head off to college, 
I'm not sure if this project will outlive this event since I could just get an engine instead of pip install pygame ce >:(
I'm also not sure if this github will outlive that

Anyway, I'll definitely change this eventually if that s even something you can do here
Maybe I'll eventually talk ab my game, but not right now

bye bye
